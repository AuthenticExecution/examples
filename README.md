# Example Authentic Execution deployments

Each folder contains a different example of Authentic Execution deployment. Each example uses different TEE technologies, some of them combine multiple TEEs together. Check the `docker-compose.yml` and `descriptor.json` files to find out the exact topology of a deployment.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are mandatory to run the examples.

- Each TEE technology needs different prerequisites. Some components/drivers may be required. [More info](https://github.com/AuthenticExecution/env#prerequisites)
